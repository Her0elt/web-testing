I am a 20 year old student who is in his second year Computer Engineering at NTNU in Trondheim. In my free time I like to exercise, hang out with friends, and program.Before I started at NTNU I went to Bj√∏rnholt High School. During my second year of High School I went on an exchange, to Texas in the USA. During my stay in the United States, I lived with an American family, and went to school.
I am very fond of challenges, especially In programming, there is nothing that beats having struggled with one problem over a long period of time, also find the solution to what you have been struggling with.

When it comes to competence in IT, I have had IT2 in high school, where I for the most part used HTML5. At NTNU, I have had programming 1 and 2, where we learned Java. Early in the second semester at NTNU, I joined a committee in the my "linje forening", which belongs to the study. In the committee we programmed the next page and others IT solutions for the line association. Here we used Reactjs for frontend development and Python with Django REST framework for backend development. During the work in committee, I have also learned how to work in teams with other developers, and we have taken in using agile methods. I have also recently started learning C ++, in association with the subject Algorithms and Data Structures. I've also recently picked up Kotlin in place of Java, and played around with GraphQL, and .NET
